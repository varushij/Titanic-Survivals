# Titanic-Survivals
Titanic Survivals (Kaggle competition) <br />
The Titanic tragedy is something everyone is aware of. Many innocent people died in this tragedy, making it one of the most tragic shipwreck in history. <br />
In this project we aim to analyse the different types of people who had higher chances of survival in this tragdedy.<br />
This is a supervised binary classsification problem, where we try to predict the survival of passengers based on various factors like the class in which they were travelling, passenger's age and gender etc.


# Prerequisites
The project was developed using jupyter notebook (version 4.4.0) with Python 3.
To run this project, following libraries needs to be installed - 
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Missingno
* Seaborn
* Sklearn

# Algorithms used
* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbor
* Support Vector Machines
* Naive Bayes
* Decision Trees <br />
**Finally, Decision Trees model was used on the test set to make the prediction of survival rate of passengers as it had the highest accuracy.**
